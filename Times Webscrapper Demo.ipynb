WASHINGTON: A stomach-churning decline in stock market on Monday morning despite the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to near zero per cent during the weekend signaled the extent of the carnage coronavirus had wrought on the US With more and more establishments, including bars and restaurants, malls and movie halls, schools and gyms, shutting down either voluntarily or by decree, rumors of Martial Law swept through social media as President Donald Trump sought to calm fears about an apocalyptic out-of-control scenario. “Take it easy…just relax,” Trump urged Americans in yet another TV appearance aimed at reassuring people increasingly spooked by reports of a run in essential commodities and shortages. Flanked by experts, he reeled off a list of grocery majors, including Albertsons, which is headed by Indian-American Vivek Sankaran, that had pledged to keep the supply chain running smoothly, while urging people not to be panicked into hoarding. Food items such as rice, flour, canned edibles, besides hand sanitizers, toilet paper, and disinfectant wipes have ben cleaned out from stores amid unprecedented foot traffic of people foraging for these items. Trump also claimed that the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai had called him to apologize, purportedly for not backing the administration’s claim that the company was setting up a coronavirus diagnostic website. “The head of Google, who is a great gentleman — said — called us — and apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. As you know, this is from Google [holds up printout of Google Communication’s statement on Twitter]. They put out a release [drops the paper on the ground] and you guys can figure it out yourselves and how that got out, and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful,” Trump rambled. But Google’s healthcare unit Verily on Monday released only a utility site limited to couple of counties in California (with a promise to expand it) that was, as it had announced before, a pilot program -- not the expansive triage system that the Trump administration said would come. The mismatch between what Trump said and what was delivered renewed charges that the U.S President is largely clueless about the crisis and is just winging it day after day. Among the statements Trump has made since the crisis began in January: \"We have it very well under control.\" \"We pretty much shut it down.\" \"The numbers are going to get progressively better.\" \"We’re going very substantially down, not up.\" \"One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.\" With some 30 million children confined to their homes, along with unemployed or furloughed workers and those heeding advice on social distancing, the world largest country in terms of economy (and third largest in terms of size) is acquiring a ghostly hue with many social and commercial transactions slowing down or grinding to a halt. Many restaurants are shuttering down to provide only take-out or delivery service and coffee chains such as Starbucks are opting for a order-to-go model in order to cut down interaction. Amid fervid speculation about curfew and martial law, some people are also raging against the enforced distancing and isolation, arguing that it goes against constitutional rights besides severely damaging the economy and hurting the working class depending on daily or hourly wages. Economic experts are also veering around to the view that a recession is inevitable and a sharp V-shaped bounce back is unlikely.

WASHINGTON: The White House put in place new measures Monday to protect President Donald Trump and his staff during the coronavirus outbreak, including taking the temperature of anyone who enters the complex, including visitors and members of the press corps. The steps expanded on screenings the White House began on Saturday for anyone who gets close to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the virus. Officials greeted staff, reporters and camera workers by swiping their foreheads with a temporal thermometer. Only those with a reading of 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37.6 degrees Celsius) or less were allowed entry into the complex. ``In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,`` spokesman Judd Deere said. The average body temperature is about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), but it can range from a little lower to a little higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it considers a person to have a fever when he or she has a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher. Inside the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, an orange sign taped to the back of many seats let reporters know that it was to remain unoccupied during briefings to ensure social distancing. The White House Correspondents' Association called on all members to stay home or work remotely if they could do so and to keep a bare level of staffing at the White House. ``We understand these restrictions are deeply disruptive to our members and their ability to do their jobs. But we are forced to take these steps to do our part to ensure that there is a healthy pool available to cover the president and inform the public during this critical time,'' the association's board said in an overnight email to members. The White House on Saturday began taking the temperature of reporters attending a coronavirus briefing led by Trump and Pence. One reporter with a temperature above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit was denied entry to the briefing room. Temperature checks were conducted before Sunday's briefing, too. Trump has had contact with people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, including the press aide for Brazil's president, but Trump initially refused to be tested. On Saturday, Trump said he had taken the test in response to questions at a Friday news conference. The White House doctor reported late Saturday that the test came back negative. Trump, 73, would be considered at risk because of his age. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. Other precautionary steps the White House is taking: pausing its internship and volunteer programs, canceling public tours and canceling large events through the end of March. The White House also has closed its Navy Mess Dining Room, where many staffers get daily meals. The White House also has encouraged staffers to follow guidelines for telework issued by the Office of Management and Budget. To limit the number of journalists in the briefing room, television networks agreed to pool camera coverage so that just one crew would cover the briefings and share footage with all the other networks, instead of having multiple crews covering the same event. That system was in place for Sunday's coronavirus briefing. ``This is an important first step for us, but we all agree more action is needed to protect our members and the integrity of the press pool covering the president,'' the White House Correspondents' Association board said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has advised his countrymen against hoarding of essential items as reports of grocery stores being swept by panic buying due to the coronavirus crisis emerged, saying supply chains in the country are the most powerful in the world and there is no shortage of daily goods. The US mainstream media, including newspapers and channels, on Sunday showed pictures and visuals of empty shelves in grocery stores in the country. Visuals of lockdown-like situation in several European countries like Italy and Spain added to the anxiety of the Americans who bought things to fill up their pantry with weeks of stocks. In view of the situation, Trump on Sunday held a meeting with top leaders of the companies that own grocery stores, including Indian-American Vivek Sankaran, who is president and CEO of Albertsons. “I would like to say that people shouldn't go out and buy. We're going to be great. We're going to be so good,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference after a meeting with nearly a dozen grocery store owners. “But you don't have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they're buying more. I remember -- I guess, during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they're buying more than they buy at Christmas. Relax. We're doing great. It all will pass,” he said. The White House said that the supply chains in the country were strong and it was unnecessary for citizens to hoard daily essentials. Among other prominent corporate leaders in the meeting were Dave Clark from Whole Foods; Mark Clouse of Campbell Soup Company; Brian Cornell of Target; Kevin Hourican of Sysco; Craig Jelinek of Costco; Donnie King of Tyson Foods; David MacLennan of Cargill; and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Referring to his meeting with corporate leaders, Trump said they assured him that they are going to meet the demands of the public. “They're going around the clock, if they have to. They are committed to the communities where they're serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they're buying a lot of additional things to sell,” he said. “But again, they actually have asked me to say- Could you buy a little bit less, please?- I thought I'd never hear that from a retailer. All of them are working hand-in-hand with the federal government, as well as the state and local leaders, to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they'll do it,” he said. “There's no shortages. We have no shortages - other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy. It's going to be there for a long time,” Trump said. Asserting that the supply chains in America are the most powerful in the world, and they're all working very hard, he said that the stores are stocking up at a level that's beyond the Christmas rush. “There's no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me- Could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it. Have a nice dinner. Relax. Because there's plenty. But you don't have to buy the quantities because it's hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they're refilling them,” Trump said. According to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,700 people and claimed 69 lives in the country. The deadly virus, which originated in China, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

WASHINGTON: The influential Indian-American doctors' community in the US has commended the steps being taken by the President Donald Trump-led administration in tackling the coronavirus outbreak which has claimed 69 lives and infected over 3,700 in the country. \"The Trump administration's proactive handling of the coronavirus situation is commendable,\" Dr Narendra Kumar, former president of the American Association of Physicians of Indian-Origin (AAPI), said in a statement issued through Al Mason, a supporter of India-US relations, who over the weekend connected over 1,000 reputed Indian-American doctors from both Democrat and Republican parties to get their feedback on the handling of the COVID-19 issue. Over 100,000 Indian-American doctors practice in the US. In view of the crisis, a large number of Indian-American doctors, including those serving in the rural areas, are working round the clock, said New York-based Mason, who is an advisor to Global Real Estate Investments, Educational and Hospital. The White House Task Force on coronavirus has put together all necessary resources with lightning speed to contain the spread of the disease and prevented an otherwise worse situation, said Dr Kumar, a practising otolaryngologist and sleep medicine specialist in Michigan. A recipient of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, Dr Kumar said closing of the border, travel restrictions and bans and finally the declaration of national emergency were done appropriately. \"I have seen very closely how the government has implemented measures to stop this pandemic, from frequent online meetings from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and other experts who delivered vital information about the coronavirus and measures taken by the hospitals to reduce spreading, to making available test kits and now several billions of dollars (provisioned) that will help us to maintain our community and our hospital prepared for this pandemic, and ultimately, eradicate it,\" said Dr Humberto Nunez from Texas. Asserting that Trump is handling the coronavirus crisis \"very effectively\", Dr Freemu Varghese, a nephrologist from Houston, exuded confidence that measures like declaration of national emergency, availability of testing kits throughout the country, and developing vaccines and drug therapy at war-footing will successfully help address the public health challenge. \"When (co-founder of Microsoft Corporation) Bill Gates made that TED talk in 2015, (the then president and vice-president) Barack Obama and (Joe) Biden should have listened after overseeing half-a-million sick people and watching tens of thousands die from the last disaster. Now we must follow the Trump team of experts,\" said Hari Namboodiri from the American Health Care Association. In the 2015 TED Talks show, Gates said the world was ill-equipped to deal with the next health outbreak. \"President Trump has been the consoler in chief trying to calm the fears of the country and the markets,\" said Dr Dheeraj Kamalam, anesthesiologist critical care intensivist and former president of Association of Kerala Medical Graduates of Greater New York. Another Indian-American medical practitioner Dr Ajeenkya D Y Patil said most of the doctors in the US were encouraged by the strong and swift measures being taken to combat the deadly disease. The administration's free coronavirus testing drive, and empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive provisions of certain laws and regulations and give maximum flexibility to healthcare providers to care for their patients have been most appreciated by the medicos. This declaration will provide HHS with critical authorities to waive licensing requirements so doctors from other states can provide services in areas with the greatest need. It will also provide critical access hospital requirements to allow those hospitals to have more beds and longer lengths of stay and rules hindering hospitals' ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. \"My personal opinion is that President Trump is doing as good a job as one could expect with all the unknowns and magnitude of this novel virus outbreak,\" said Dr Dilip B Viswanath, cardiovascular associate from Delaware Valley. Closing borders will help reduce transmission, he added. \"Although everybody is concerned about being/getting tested I worry that a negative test may create a false sense of security when one can just as easily be exposed the next day or even the same day. Agreeably a positive would presumably change behaviour and hence reduce transmission,\" he said. Instituting a multi-faceted plan will certainly help slow down the spread of the virus and allow America to recover sooner, said Dr John Lee from New York, adding that many official procedures have been cut and vaccines and cure developments have been put on a fast track. He said nearly 2 million free coronavirus tests were available this week itself. According to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,700 people and claimed 69 lives in the country. The deadly virus, which originated in China, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

WASHINGTON: With panic buying on Main Street and fear-driven sell-offs on Wall Street, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday in another emergency move to help shore up the US economy amid the rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic. New York City Bill de Blasio on Sunday said he was ordering restaurants, bars and cafes to only sell food on a take-out or delivery basis. He also said he would order nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses and concert venues to close. \"This is not a decision I make lightly,\" the mayor said in a written statement. \"These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality.\" For the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed cut rates at an emergency meeting, aiming for a target range of 0% to 0.25% to help put a floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy. US President Donald Trump, who had openly pressed the Fed for further action, called the move \"terrific\" and \"very good news.\" More on Covid-19  Coronavirus: What are the symptoms 52 testing sites for coronavirus in India Helpline numbers for states and UTs Do fever and cough mean you need Covid-19 test? How to stay safe How to quarantine yourself at home Americans are waking up to a new reality as coronavirus spreads, with store shelves stripped bare of essentials, schools closed and millions of jobs in jeopardy as businesses temporarily shut their doors. New York City joined the nation's other major public school systems in calling off classes starting this week. \"We're learning from watching other countries,\" Trump said. \"It's a very contagious virus ... but it's something that we have tremendous control of.\" Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageTrump has faced criticism at home and abroad for sometimes downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus and overstating his administration's ability to handle it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said the United States was entering a new phase of coronavirus testing but tempered the president's optimism. \"The worst is yet ahead for us,\" Fauci said, a warning he has issued frequently in the past week. \"It is how we respond to that challenge that is going to what the ultimate end point is going to be.\" US Vice President Mike Pence said testing for coronavirus was expanding with more than 2,000 labs across the country ready to process tests and 10 states operating drive-through testing. US Assistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir said there will be 1.9 million high-throughput tests available this week. The United States has lagged behind other industrialized nations in its ability to test for the coronavirus. In early March, the Trump administration said close to 1 million coronavirus tests would soon be available and anyone who needed a test would get one, a promise it failed to keep. With limited testing available, US officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 65 deaths, up from 58 on Saturday. Globally more than 162,000 are infected and over 6,000 have died. Pence also said the government on Monday morning would issue updated federal guidelines, which he described as \"broad-based recommendations for the American public.\" The US Centers for Disease Control on Sunday recommended that events with gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks be postponed or canceled. DON'T HOARDThe White House appealed to Americans not to hoard as the coronavirus spreads, reassuring them that grocery supply chains were strong. Trump held a phone call on Sunday with 30 executives from grocery stores including Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods, Target Corp, Costco Wholesale Corp and Walmart Inc, the White House said. \"Have a nice dinner, relax because there's plenty, but you don't have to ... you don't have to buy the quantities,\" Trump said. \"We're doing really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen.\" Trump tested negative for coronavirus, his doctors said on Saturday, as the president extended a travel ban to Britain and Ireland to try to slow the pandemic. Trump's spokesman, Judd Deere, said temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters the White House grounds, beginning Monday morning. Travelers returning to the United States and being screened for the coronavirus were met by long lines and massive delays at some major airports, prompting federal officials to deploy more staff and Trump to appeal for patience. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, squaring off in a Democratic debate, blasted Trump's handling of the coronavirus and touted their own plans to deal with it. In their first one-on-one debate, the two Democratic contenders to face Trump in the November election said the Republican president had contributed to worries about the pandemic by minimizing the threat before declaring a national emergency on Friday. CLOSURES EXPANDThe US containment measures have so far been mild compared to the nationwide lockdowns imposed in Italy, France and Spain. However, Ohio and Illinois on Sunday ordered all bars and restaurants to close, although carry-out and delivery are still allowed. \"I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,\" Fauci said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Fauci said he did not see domestic travel restrictions in the immediate future. Even though Americans are not barred from going to the movies, ticket sales in North America fell to their lowest level in more than two decades this weekend, according to measurement firm Comscore. NEW YORK SCHOOLS CLOSEDDemocratic New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that schools in New York City, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would close from Monday, and he called on Trump to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers to create more hospital beds. Cuomo had been criticized for not closing schools as other states have done, given that New York has a large cluster of coronavirus cases. A clinical trial to evaluate a vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus will begin on Monday, the Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed US government official. It would take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine, the AP added, citing public health officials. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: Massive bottlenecks were reported across U.S airports unprepared to filter in Americans rushing home amid the coronavirus shutdown even as President Trump, called out for sloppy handling of the entire situation starting with airily saying it will go away, tested negative for the virus. With most businesses and engagements across the country being pared down, if not shutting down altogether, the world’s largest economy lurched towards a recession while Trump called for a national day of prayer on Sunday and took part in a remote service. Social distancing, remote engagement, and flattening the curve continued to be key terms as experts across the spectrum emphasized the need to slow down the spread of the virus with alarming statistics of what might be if it is not contained. America’s top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci called for a dramatic reduction in personal interaction to curb its spread. The biggest concern arising from this approach centered on whether in the short term the supply chain of food and essential commodities would be disrupted after a run on goods by panicked customers, with at least one report of a run on hard currency in an New York City bank. The longer term fear is that it could crater the economy. Amid dire prognosis of how the world could be laid low by the virus, there was plenty of hope on the medical front in treating it effectively – from using Anti-HIV drugs to the simpler chloroquine – even while slowing down its spread with compartmentalized isolation of countries, cities, and communities, so as to give health care infrastructure and medical science time to get its act together. Often lost in the panic was the fact that those who contract Covid-19 and survive it (99 cent of affected do, with more than 80 per cent having very mild symptoms) are subsequently immune to it. While there was anger at how sloppily the Trump administration is managing the return of Americans to the U.S – with four to eight hour long crowded waits reported at some airports for covid-19 testing before immigration clearance – American millennials were also roasted for partying like there is no tomorrow – which is apparently what some of them believe. Responding to reports that bars in cities across the country were packed with young people who believe they are either immune or don’t care, community leaders urged them to be less selfish for the sake of their parents and grandparents. They could be passing the virus to elders if even they themselves are asymptomatic. Trending on top of Twitter is the hashtag #StayTheFHome. Consequently bars and restaurants have begun shuttering down, and along with the slow down in transport sector, the virus is now threatening to crush the economy. Some Republican lawmakers, notably Trump supporter Devin Nunes, are challenging the approach, saying if people are healthy, they should be going out and patronizing restaurants and other businesses so as to not hurt workers and the economy. But infectious disease and healthcare experts believe that is a dumb thing to do even though there are fears that a devastated economy could be an even bigger silent killer than the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has declared Sunday a National Day of Prayer for all affected by the coronavirus and pointed how the Americans, in times of need, have always turned to prayer to seek guidance through trials and periods of uncertainty. \"As we continue to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are unable to gather in their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship,\" the President said hours after he declared a national emergency in the United States due to the health crisis provoked by the killer bug that killed at least 58 people and infected 2,816 others. \"But in this time we must not cease asking God for added wisdom, comfort, and strength, and we must especially pray for those who have suffered harm or who have lost loved ones. I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for God's healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation,\" he added. Urging his countrymen to pray for the health and well-being of the fellow Americans who have been suffering due to the viral infection, Trump said, \"remember that no problem is too big for God to handle.\" \"With God's help, we will overcome this threat,\" he stressed. The first Sunday of every March since 1988 has been designated a National Day of Prayer in the United States. \"It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer,\" Trump wrote. We are a country that, throughout our history, have looked to God for protection and strength in times like these,\" he said. \"No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!\" Trump wrote in a follow-up tweet. Elsewhere in the US, Americans were grappling with life under the coronavirus and everything that came with it: school closures, travel restrictions, empty grocery store shelves, cancelled worship services and a near-halt of recreational and entertainment events. A ban restricting travel from a large swath of Europe to the US went into effect Friday night, and will be extended to include the UK and Ireland, officials said at a White House briefing Saturday. The new restrictions are set to go into effect at midnight on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence was quoted as saying by CNN. Trump, himself, took a coronavirus test on Friday night, he told reporters Saturday, after facing questions about whether he had been tested at a news conference the day before. The White House later said the test was negative. The President also released $50 billion aid in federal resources to combat the outbreak. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, his doctor said on Saturday, as the US president extended a travel ban to Britain and Ireland to try to slow the spread of a pandemic that has shut down much of the daily routine of American life. After White House officials took the unprecedented step of checking the temperatures of journalists entering the briefing room, Trump told reporters he took a test for the virus on Friday night. On Saturday evening, his physician, Sean Conley, said the results were negative. The U.S. president met with a Brazilian delegation last week, at least one member of which has since tested positive.   Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updates  Trump said Americans should reconsider non-essential travel, and that his administration was also considering domestic travel restrictions. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the country has recorded 2,226 case of the new coronavirus but has not yet reached the peak of the outbreak. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage\"This will get worse before it gets better,\" Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at the briefing. But, he added, \"99% of people will recover and people need to know that.\" Critics have accused Trump of focusing too much on markets, which on Friday saw the three major Wall Street indexes gain more than 9% after having had their worst day since 1987 on Thursday. All three indexes were nevertheless down at least 8% for the week and about 20% below mid-February record highs.

How to stay safe How to quarantine yourself at home At the briefing, Trump told reporters he was \"honored to see that the stock market set a record in a short period of time over a 45-minute period.\" He called it an \"all-time record\" that he hoped would be repeated daily. \"They said, 'Sir, you just set a record in the history of the stock market. That was pretty good. Those great companies that were there, they couldn't have been too unhappy about it ... They are all big, publicly listed companies, so they did a good job,\" he said before turning the microphone over to Vice President Mike Pence, who is running the White House's response to the outbreak. Pence said the administration was extending to Britain and Ireland travel restrictions that were first imposed on China and expanded this week to continental Europe. AIRLINES PLAN FLIGHT CUTSUS airlines, which have already been battered by the restrictions and a steep drop in demand, said on Saturday that they were preparing more flight cuts. Pence said the new restrictions will take effect at midnight on Monday. Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, said Trump decided to add Britain to the travel ban because of the rising number of coronavirus cases there. Health authorities in England announced on Saturday a further 10 deaths caused by COVID-19, almost doubling the number of fatalities in Britain since Friday. A senior DHS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Britain and Ireland were added because the United States was not able effectively to determine whether travelers from those countries were trying to sidestep the European travel ban. \"The travel investigation couldn't be effectively managed on our side,\" the senior DHS official said. U.S. citizens and legal residents will still be able to return home and will be funneled through certain airports, Pence said. The vice president also told reporters that visits to nursing homes were being suspended to protect the most vulnerable. A nursing home in Washington state has been the site of most of the U.S. deaths caused by the coronavirus. On Saturday, officials in New York confirmed that state's first two fatalities from the outbreak: an 82-year-old woman in New York City's borough of Brooklyn, and a man in his 60s in Rockland County, north of the city. Both had underlying health problems, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said. Nationwide, at least 58 people have died. SHELVES PICKED CLEANThe pandemic has forced public schools, sports events and cultural and entertainment venues to close across the United States. American shoppers picked grocery store shelves clean of products ranging from disinfectants and toilet paper to rice and milk, causing retailers to race to restock their stores. In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits. On Saturday morning, about 500 people were lined up for two blocks outside a Costco in Garden Grove, California, waiting for the store to open. Long lines of shoppers were reported outside food stores in other parts of the United States. On Friday, Trump declared a national emergency in a move that he said would bring \"the full power of the federal government\" to bear on the escalating health crisis by freeing up some $50 billion in aid. He also urged every state to set up emergency centers to help fight the virus. Early on Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that would provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from the outbreak. Economists say the impact of the outbreak on businesses could tip the U.S. economy into recession.

WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared the coronavirus pandemic an emergency by invoking a law known as the Stafford Act. Here’s how the Stafford Act works and the powers the declaration unlocks. WHAT IS THE STAFFORD ACT?The law, enacted in 1988, empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist state and local governments during “natural catastrophes” and coordinate the nation’s response. FEMA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, controls more than $40 billion in federal funding set aside by Congress for disaster relief. FEMA could use that funding to help build medical facilities and transport patients, among other measures. Only the president can declare a major disaster under the law. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage“We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. “I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I’ll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don’t even know about.” Trump has invoked the Stafford Act many times during his presidency, approving major disaster declarations to address flooding in the Midwest and wildfires in California, among other events. FEMA is commonly associated with natural disaster responses but the agency can also address pandemics. In 2000, former President Bill Clinton used a Stafford Act emergency declaration to pay for mosquito control efforts to address outbreaks of the West Nile virus in New Jersey and New York.

How to stay safe How to quarantine yourself at home  DIDN’T THE U.S. ALREADY DECLARE CORONAVIRUS AN EMERGENCY?A different government agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in late January and has been the lead agency addressing the pandemic. Coronavirus outbreak live updatesHHS’s declaration, made under a different law than the Stafford Act, allowed U.S. officials to impose restrictions on individuals entering the country from China, among other measures. Several state governments have declared emergencies, allowing them to mandate containment zones like the one in New Rochelle, New York, and address price-gouging. WHAT OTHER LAWS COULD TRUMP INVOKE?Last year, Trump declared an emergency on the U.S.-Mexican border to circumvent Congress and take money already designated for other programs to pay for his wall on the souther border, which he promised to build during his 2016 campaign. That declaration was made under the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The law does not define “emergency,” giving the president broad discretion to declare one. An emergency declaration under the National Emergencies Act unlocks sweeping presidential powers, like the ability to seize control of the internet or suspend laws, while a Stafford Act declaration deals only with FEMA. In 2009, former President Barack Obama declared the H1N1 influenza, or “swine flu,” pandemic to be a national emergency under that law. Obama’s declaration waived some federal health insurance rules to speed treatment. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: The United States declared a state of emergency Friday as many European countries went on a war footing amid mounting deaths as the world mobilized to fight the widening coronavirus pandemic. At the White House, where US President Donald Trump made the emergency decree, drug company executives vowed to work together and with the government to quickly expand the country's coronavirus testing capabilities, which are far behind those in many countries. \"We will defeat this threat,\" Trump told a news conference. \"When America is tested, America rises to the occasion.\" While the aggressive spread of the virus in Europe, North America and the Middle East has dashed any hopes for quick containment, dozens of countries have imposed increasingly severe measures over the past couple days _ shutting borders, expanding testing, closing school for tens of millions of children and ordering tens of thousands of businesses to close their doors _ to try to face down the disease. The US emergency decree will open up $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak, said Trump, who also gave the secretary of health and human services emergency powers to waive federal regulations to give doctors and hospitals \"flexibility\" in treating patients. As the US struggles to slow the spread of the virus, the governors of six states _ Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New York, Rhode Island and Washington - sought National Guard troops. Trump's announcement came as tens of millions of students around the world faced weeks without classes, security forces went on standby to guard against large gatherings, and bars, restaurants and offices closed. While the new coronavirus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and people with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover. But the spreading pandemic showed that power and influence offer no protection. Among those testing positive were the Canadian prime minister's wife, a top aide to Iran's supreme leader, Miami's mayor, a Brazilian official who met with Trump, and an Australian Cabinet minister who met with the US attorney general and Trump's daughter, Ivanka. Pressed by reporters, Trump, who also met with the Brazilian official, said he will \"most likely\" be tested for the virus \"fairly soon,\" reversing an earlier White House statement. Channeling wartime rhetoric and tactics in the face of a microscopic enemy, leaders appealed for solidarity to battle a threat that appeared to expand exponentially. They vowed to protect not just the sick, but those sacrificing their livelihoods and education for the greater good. But new border checks were also on the rise, showing that solidarity had its limits in the face of a fast-moving threat. In Europe, stocks clawed back some of their losses with promises of financial support from the European Commission, France and Germany, while in the US, stocks surged after Trump's announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 2,000 points _ its biggest point gain ever. At the same time, new infections in Italy soared by more than 2,500 and virus-related deaths made their biggest single-day jump there, increasing by 250. In the three weeks since the country identified its first virus cluster, Italy has reached a total of 17,600 confirmed cases, with 1,266 deaths. The government has ordered an unprecedented lockdown, ordering businesses to close and restricting movement. \"Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic,\" said World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.\" New infections also rose sharply in Spain, and the government put 60,000 people in four towns on a mandatory lockdown Friday that echoed Italy's. In Madrid, which is struggling with nearly 2,000 infections, many in nursing homes, the government was pooling intensive care units and considering offers by hotel chains to transform rooms into sick wards. In just 24 hours, the numbers of confirmed cases spiked ominously in some places: France saw an additional 800 cases to reach more than 3,600 by Friday; Britain went from 590 to 798 and New York state jumped 30 percent, hitting 421. In Africa, where experts warn that containment is key because of the continent's already-strained health care systems, six new countries confirmed infections. Cases topped 1,700 across the US, where thousands of schools have been closed, concerts and sporting events canceled and even Broadway theaters shut down. Trump has halted his trademark political rallies, following the lead of Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. The spread of the virus in Europe, North America and the Middle East has drawn contrasts with waning outbreaks in the hardest-hit nations in Asia. China, where the virus emerged late last year, still accounts for more than 60% of global infections but reported just eight new cases Friday and seven deaths. In South Korea, which has had more than 8,000 cases overall, Friday marked the first day that recoveries outnumbered new infections. It reported another 107 cases Saturday. In the US, hospitals were setting up circus-like triage tents, calling doctors out of retirement, guarding their supplies of face masks and making plans to cancel elective and non-emergency surgeries as they brace for an expected onslaught of coronavirus patients in the coming weeks. Trump, who on Thursday ordered a 30-day travel ban for most foreign visitors coming to the US from continental Europe, dismissed criticism that his administration has faced for the slow rollout of testing in the US, saying \"I don't take responsibility at all\" for the problem. The public-private partnership that Trump announced at the White House will include drive-thru testing in some areas _ something already being done in South Korea and Germany _ and an online portal to screen those seeking to get tested. Late Friday, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the Trump administration for an aid package that would provide free tests, sick pay for workers and bolster food programs. The US House was poised to vote on the deal. Across America, where millions of children depend on school lunches as their main meals, schools were cobbling together ways to keep kids fed, from distributing grand-and-go meal sacks to cafeterias that remained open even as classrooms closed. In Italy, the town of Codogno, which had all but shut down hours after recording the country's first locally spread coronavirus infection, showed that changing habits do make a difference. New infections have slowed drastically there compared to the rest of Italy, where draconian measures came far later. \"More than a sigh of relief, there was some concern over the risk that all of the sacrifices were in vain,\" said Mayor Francesco Passerini. New travel restrictions sprang up practically by the hour on Friday: Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Portugal, the Czech Republic _ all started barring entry to Europeans considered at risk. Ukraine announced it would halt all passenger air traffic, Poland said anyone entering the country will be put under a 14-day quarantine, while the Czech Republic and Slovakia have stopped almost all movement in and out of their countries. The European Union urged member countries to put health screening procedures in place at their borders. Canada and Denmark joined the US in advising citizens to avoid trips abroad, and Americans in Europe caught increasingly rare trans-Atlantic flights back home.

WASHINGTON: The United States declared a state of emergency Friday as many European countries went on a war footing amid mounting deaths as the world mobilized to fight the widening coronavirus pandemic. At the White House, where US President Donald Trump made the emergency decree, drug company executives vowed to work together and with the government to quickly expand the country's coronavirus testing capabilities, which are far behind those in many countries. \"We will defeat this threat,\" Trump told a news conference. \"When America is tested, America rises to the occasion.\" While the aggressive spread of the virus in Europe, North America and the Middle East has dashed any hopes for quick containment, dozens of countries have imposed increasingly severe measures over the past couple days _ shutting borders, expanding testing, closing school for tens of millions of children and ordering tens of thousands of businesses to close their doors _ to try to face down the disease. The US emergency decree will open up $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak, said Trump, who also gave the secretary of health and human services emergency powers to waive federal regulations to give doctors and hospitals \"flexibility\" in treating patients.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a \"great\" friend and it was an incredible two days in India, US President Donald Trump said on his last month visit to the country. Trump was on his maiden official visit to India from February 24 to 25. He was accompanied by First Lady Melania and a high-powered delegation comprising senior US administration officials, including National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. They visited Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi before leaving for Washington. “We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days and he (Modi) is a great friend of mine,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference. “He's a friend of his people because he was greeted incredibly warmly as was I in that stadium. That was an incredible event. And I loved being with him,” Trump said. “We talked about everything. We talked about far more than just borders,” said the president in response to a question. During the visit, India and the US finalised defence deals under which 30 military helicopters will be procured from two American defence majors for the Indian armed forces.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is expected to declare a national emergency and shutter down America, including isolating some states and hotspots within the country, after expert warning that up to 150 million people could be affected without adequate checks to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus. Trump is expected to make a national address at 3 p.m to outline new measures even as mighty America is shuttering down in front of a lowly virus. The US President himself is under the gun, after it emerged that he spent time at Mar-a-lago last weekend with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose press secretary also shook hands with Trump, tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro himself was tested and found negative his son said, even as reports initially said a first test had shown positive, throwing the world into a tizzy. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went into self-quarantine after his wife tested positive and social interactions with a British team. Separately, it emerged that the President’s daughter Ivanka was with the Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who has subsequently tested positive for the virus. The U.S President though has been adamant that he is not in danger and there is no word from the White House whether the President and his daughter are quarantining themselves. Trump is expected to have a video conference with European leaders on Monday as the world leadership finally begins to act in concert to contain the spread of the virus after day sfof individual, uncoordinated action. \"Following my call with @realDonaldTrump and all G7 leaders, we agreed to organize an extraordinary Leaders Summit by videoconference on Monday on Covid-19. We will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,\" French President Emanuel Macron tweeted, having apparently taken the initiative. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed greatest country on earth, which its President said last week was well prepared to blow off the challenged from the virus, is going down on its knees and cowering in fright before the global pandemic, gradually turning into a ghost county that Italy has become. Theme parks such as Disneyland and Universal Studios shut down, schools began closing nationwide, and everything from Broadway theater to box office shows to Boston Marathon were deferred amid a global stress test that is putting things ranging from personal hygiene to social behaviour under scrutiny. News that even global elites such as the Trumps and Trudeaus are vulnerable to the virus drove home the universal danger the virus poses, with social engagement increasing susceptibility. The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau being diagnosed with the virus, forcing him into self-quarantine, brought renewed focus on the Trump family, with both the U.S President and his daughter Ivanka found to have consorted with people who have subsequently been found infected with the virus. Trump remained adamant that he is not under risk and will not be tested but many other political elites with second and third degree separation from the virus -- including lawmakers such as Senator Lindsey Graham -- dialed down their engagement and went into self-isolation as “social distancing” became the phrase du jour. One of the more terrifying prognosis came from Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, who reportedly told a closed-door Congressional staff meeting that 70 million to 150 million people in the U.S. will become infected with COVID-19 without adequate action. Even at one per cent mortality rate such a catastrophe could kill 700,000 to 1.5 million people. Amid such dire warnings, President Trump sought to blame his predecessor Barack Obama for the situation, tweeting \"For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further...\"  “Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!” he added. But critics called his bluff and excoriated him for rolling up the US pandemic response team and cutting CDC funding during his time in office even as reports from the ground spoke of the difficulty in getting tested. The pandemic also turned many raving American capitalists who abhor the word socialism and rage against the government's role in daily life into ardent socialists as they sought government intervention in the marketplace to manage testing, vaccination etc. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Friday morning that coronavirus testing in the United States will soon happen on a large scale, but did not provide any details on how that would be accomplished. \"The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!\" he wrote in a tweet. Trump also criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the US organizations leading the fight against the deadly infection, for having a testing system that he said would \"always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic.\" Trump did not elaborate on why the system was inadequate, but on Thursday, the top US official on infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, said people cannot get tests easily and the US testing system \"is not really geared to what we need right now.\" US officials and lawmakers are struggling to get a sense of how many people in the country have contracted the virus, which they attribute to low testing rates.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is personally making the case for Namaste in the time of coronavirus, referring to his recent trip to India and relating how he and Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar greeted each other the Indian way when they met at the White House on Thursday. “We looked at each other and said what do we gonna do….sort of a weird feeling. And we did this,” Trump said with a namaste gesture in the Oval office at a White House appearance with Varadkar, who is also part Indian-origin (his father is Maharashtrian). \"I just got back from India. And I didn’t shake any hands there. It was very easy. You do this (shows Namaste gesture)…and Japan goes like this (bows). They were ahead of the curve,\" Trump added. The U.S President appeared a chastened man after he was panned for treating the coronavirus spread lightly last week when he maintained he would not give up shaking hands and that the virus would simply go away because the U.S was so well-prepared for it. Instead, the virus has spread, infecting even celebrities and causing emergency measures in New York and Washington DC as it skirts close to the center of power. Trump himself is coming under scrutiny after it was revealed that he was in close proximity last Saturday at his residence in Mara-a-Lago, Florida, to a senior Brazilian official, who has subsequently been diagnosed with coronavirus. The U.S President continues to be blasé about it even though the official, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s press secretary, is now in quarantine, and Bolsonaro himself has cancelled all his appointments and is said to be under observation. Like Trump, Bolsanaro too made light of the pandemic last week, saying it a “fantasy” and did not represent a crisis. In Video:COVID-19: Trump’s key takeaway from IndiaDownload The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: The much-loved actor Tom Hanks, his wife Rita Wilson, and two NBA players were among those who were reported to have contracted the coronavirus on Thursday, putting celebrity faces on a pandemic that is causing spasmodic and uncoordinated response from governments across the world as they sought to slow down its spread. In a nationally televised address on Wednesday night, US President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented 30-day ban on air traffic from Europe, roiling an already turbulent stock market and street mood in the US that is taking a dim view of his approach to the problem. He initially made light of it last week saying there were only 15 cases in the US and they would be gone soon because of America's \"incredible\" response. Instead, there is growing concern that Washington's response has been slow and sloppy. On Wednesday night, Trump ramped it up with a selective ban on flights from Europe, following up on a similar ban on flights from China. Direct non-stop flights from India to the US are still operational. While US markets tanked into bear territory when it opened Thursday morning – causing trading to be halted for the second time this week —Washington’s European allies, already leery of Trump, expressed anger at the sudden move that for unspecified reason excluded the United Kingdom and Ireland. Trump’s one-month ban on flights from Europe starting Friday night caused chaos on the continent with Americans scrambling to get back home from across the pond amid reports that some were paying as much as $20,000 to get on to a plane. Vice-President Mike Pence followed up Trump’s sketchy address with several clarifications, including assurances that American citizens and permanent residents will be allowed to come home even after the Friday midnight ban, but they will be asked to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days, whether they have coronavirus symptoms or not, once they land. It was not clear how they would return once flights cease, but the expectations are that airlines will run special characters as they did in the case of returnees from China. The administration is designating 13 airports where the evacuation flights can land — Honolulu, Chicago, Dallas, L.A.X, San Francisco, Atlanta, JFK, Seattle, Washington DC, Newark and Detroit, plus two yet to be named. Postponements, deferments, and cancellations cascaded across the nation as scientific and epidemiological advice pointed to the need to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus spread in order to gain time – to get a better fix on it in terms of erecting infrastructure, long-term sustainable policies, institute personal and public protocols, and mostly importantly, develop a vaccine. The National Basketball Association suspended its season, as did Major League Soccer, and Capitol Hill, home of the House of Representative and the Senate, shut down after a Congressional staffer was diagnosed with the virus. President Trump got hammered from all sides for lack of decisive leadership, despite moves such as a payroll tax cut, getting health insurance companies to waive copayments for coronavirus tests, and possible deferment of the April 15 tax-filing deadline. He exacerbated the criticism with a sketchy address to the nation prefaced with a hot mic incident showing him using an expletive because he got an ink stain on himself and asking if anyone had “some white stuff” with which he could remove it. There was also criticism of US lawmakers referring to Covid-19 as the Wuhan virus and China virus – Trump himself called it a “foreign” virus – even as the illness was spreading across secondary borders beyond China. Hanks and his wife caught it in Australia where they were shooting for a movie. Trump himself came under scrutiny after it was disclosed that he was in close proximity with a Brazilian official who was with him at Mar-a-Lago last Saturday and who was subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus. Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was not concerned about being exposed to the coronavirus after dining last week with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a government official who has since tested positive for the disease. The day after announcing curbs on travel to the United States by European Union residents, Trump brushed off concerns about his possible exposure to the virus, which has sickened more than 126,000 people in a worldwide pandemic. \"Let's put it this way: I'm not concerned,\" Trump told reporters while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office. The news comes as Trump faces perhaps the greatest crisis of his presidency, and as he seeks re-election later this year. The front-runner seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, is due to speak on the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday afternoon. Brazilian officials on Thursday confirmed that Bolsonaro's communications secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, has the coronavirus and is now under quarantine at his home. Wajngarten had posted photos on social media of the meeting at Trump's Florida resort at the weekend, showing him standing next to Trump wearing a \"Make Brazil Great Again\" cap. Vice President Mike Pence was next to Trump Download The Times of India News App for Latest World News. WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said Friday he would \"likely\" be tested soon for the novel coronavirus, although he stressed he is \"displaying no symptoms.\" Trump was pressed repeatedly during a White House news conference on whether he should be tested after coming into contact with a Brazilian official now known to have Covid-19. The president initially shut down the question, saying that per the advice of White House doctors, \"I don't have any of the symptoms.\" \"And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test,\" he told reporters. But when grilled by reporters about his encounter with the official at his Florida resort, he changed tack, saying: \"I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested\" and that he \"most likely\" would be, \"fairly soon.\" \"Not for that reason but because I think I will do it anyway,\" Trump said.
